# Wasp-Reproduction
The data can be found in the file titled: Mealy_Data.xlsx

## Introduction

When we use natural enemies to reduce invasive species population, we refer the natural enemies as "biological control agents". Female wasps (biocontrol agent) lay their eggs and the developing parasitoid larvae kill pest eggs by feeding inside the pest egg. 

## Objective

I want to test if some plants can increase reproduction of wasps in order to control the pest population, specifically mealy pests.

## Understanding the Experiment

Can plants increase the reproduction of wasps? 

Scientists tested with Buckwheat, Vetch, and water only. Each of these treatments were placed in a container with a female wasp as well as mealy eggs. The variables recorded were the following: treatment, longevity, male, female, total, and sex ratio. 

## Descriptive Analysis

**Independent Variable:** Treatment

**Dependent Variables:** Longevity, Male, Female, Total, and Sex Ratio
